          <p>I have already read 8 books while sheltering in place. My favorite book so far has been either City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert or The Untethered Soul by Michael Alan Singer. As much as I love paperback books, I went against everything I've ever known and purchased a Kindle. I even invested in a Kindle because I don't have enough space for all of the books I'm acquiring. So far, I really like how lightweight and easy to use it is. It doesn't even feel like I'm using a device. </p>

          <p>Physically and mentally, I have used this time to get on track and stay on track. Workouts I have been loving include virtual classes from the Obé fitness app, Corepower Yoga, and I've also been taking my dog on lots of walks. In addition, I've made sure to practice meditation daily, and I'm on a 23 day streak of doing that for at least 10 minutes a day. For meditation, I really like the Headspace app. Thank goodness for technology because I would probably be a potato without these technological motivations. </p>

          <h1 class="cardHI">Playing Animal Crossing</h1>
          <p>I love Animal Crossing New Horizons so much. I recently got a Nintendo Switch and I have dedicated a good chunk of my free time to playing Animal Crossing. It is really taking me back to the good old days of being in middle school, and playing City Folk and Wild World on my Nintendo DS and Wii. The nostalgia of the good old days is hitting very hard, especially in these trying times. There are so many great things about Animal Crossing, but it's mostly an isolated introvert's dream world. It is relaxing, and provides lots of creative opportunities! I also love how the game is played in real time, and the environment changes by the hour, season, etc. Did I mention how much I love this game?</p>
