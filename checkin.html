      <h1>How I've Been</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>My last quarter of college is definitely not going as planned. This is by far the most Black-Mirror-esque year of my life and I'll never forget the year 2020 in general, and we're not even halfway through it! I feel very lucky that I've been able to secure a full time job starting at the end of June, so right now I'm just focused on the final lap, and finishing classes as strong as possible.</p>

      <h1>How are you doing?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>I hope you're doing as well as possible if you're reading this! Staying safe, happy, and healthy is the most important thing right now. I encourage my peers to take this strange time of isolation to first of all relax, better ourselves, and have gratitude for the plethora of remaining good things in our individual lives! Also please wear a mask in public! And social distance yourselves! :)</p>
