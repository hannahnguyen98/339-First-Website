              <p>I highly recommend watching this on Netflix. It is a completely improvised two person show. Every show is different and made up on the spot. I've never watched long form improve comedy before and I laughed a lot watching this. </p>

              <p>I loved this movie. I saw it in theaters a while ago, so I watched it for a second time at home to show my family. The movie has the vibe of the board game Clue, and will keep you on the edge of your seat! </p>

              <p>I just started the free trial of HBO Max just to watch a few Studio Ghibli films at home. One of my all time favorite movies, Spirited Away, can now my streamed and that is very exciting. If you haven't seen this movie before, what are you waiting for?</p>
